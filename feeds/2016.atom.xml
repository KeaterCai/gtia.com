&lt;p&gt;Don't let the GW2k name full you, this is a 15" Sony Trinitron monitor, capable of 1024x768 at 75Hz. It was a pretty sweet monitor back in 1994, and still is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the CRT, especially since I can adjust the screen to fill it up and the lower 640x400 resolution doesn't look as blocky as it does when using an LCD. I did try out a Dell 20" 4:3 LCD that I use with my retrocomputers, but it wouldn't expand out the image to fill the screen. The Gateway monitor looks sweet anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everyone moving to LCDs, I wonder if I can find a VGA CRT that will sync with the Atari models...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
