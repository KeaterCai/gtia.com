&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a Nec Multisync 1970VX VGA monitor for use on my older RGB computers (Atari ST/STE/Amiga/CoCo 3/800XL with VBXE). It works well with the Amiga.

&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a Nec Multisync 1970VX VGA monitor for use on my older RGB computers (Atari ST/STE/Amiga/CoCo 3/800XL with VBXE). It works well with the Amiga. Unfortunately, I can't get it to show up with my Mega STe. I haven't tried it with any of my other STs, but I'm thinking that the cable may not be right. I ordered a cable from Best and will try it after it arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen looks really good with the Amiga 500 though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or so ago I purchased a Nec Accusync LCD 71V after reading it was compatible with the 15KHz refresh of these older computers. At the time I couldn't get a machine to work with it, so I assumed it wouldn't. Well, I tried it again and it worked with the Amiga. I have no idea what I was doing wrong before. I prefer the 1970VX though, since it is a 19" screen vs the 17" of the 71V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm beginning to miss CRTs. Hopefully, in the future, scan doublers and upscalers will take advantage of the higher resolution screens that are available, making the CRT discussion moot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="amiga"></category><category term="monitor"></category><category term="vga"></category></entry><entry><title>Continuing playing around with the VT420</title><link href="https://gtia.com/2018/10/23/continuing-playing-around-with-the-vt420/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-23T19:53:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-10-23T19:53:00+02:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:gtia.com,2018-10-23:/2018/10/23/continuing-playing-around-with-the-vt420/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've got everything working pretty well, with only a few nagging

I can't get vim to work, I guess I can use something like nano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't let the GW2k name fool you, this is a 15" Sony Trinitron monitor, capable of 1024x768 at 75Hz. It was a pretty sweet monitor back in 1994, and still is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the CRT, especially since I can adjust the screen to fill it up and the lower 640x400 resolution doesn't look as blocky as it does when using an LCD. I did try out a Dell 20" 4:3 LCD that I use with my retrocomputers, but it wouldn't expand out the image to fill the screen. The Gateway monitor looks sweet anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everyone moving to LCDs, I wonder if I can find a VGA CRT that will sync with the Atari models...&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>VBXE and Ultimate 1MB success!</title><link href="https://gtia.com/2015/12/29/vbxe-and-ultimate-1mb-success/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-29T18:41:00+01:00</published><updated>2015-12-29T18:41:00+01:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:gtia.com,2015-12-29:/2015/12/29/vbxe-and-ultimate-1mb-success/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After several hours of troubleshooting and beating on it, I'm proud to show off my successful installation of the VBXE along with an Ultimate 1M:&lt;/p&gt;

It waited patiently for years until I stumbled across a post on AtariAge about using the Xbox with emulators that piqued my interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon firing up the Xbox, I was surprised that it was still functional. Well, sort of. It usually took a few tries to fire up. I installed a larger hard drive in it and grabbed AtariXLBox from &lt;a href="http://xport.xbox-scene.com/"&gt;Xport&lt;/a&gt; along with a bunch of A8 games in various formats. It was able to play all of them without a hitch. In fact, with the Xbox plugged into a CRT TV, it was pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a big emulation person, I’d rather be playing on the real thing, but using an Xbox has it’s advantages. For one, I can easily take it places and play several systems on it (there are emulators for all of the major consoles and arcade). It doesn’t support the multi-joy adapter from what I’ve seen, but I should be able to set up the 3rd joypad to work as the third player in Dynakillers. Lastly, it does support saving the settings on a game-by-game basis which makes it easier to start games up without worrying about what hardware the game requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be relatively inexpensive to try out this route. An original Xbox usually goes for under $50 on eBay, but if you look at garage sales or Craigslist you can probably find it cheaper. You’ll need to do some research on how to mod the Xbox so you can run the emulators. This usually involves using certain games with certain save files that trick the Xbox into running unsigned code. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="xbox"></category><category term="emulation"></category></entry><entry><title>Fired up my Colecovision Adam for the first time</title><link href="https://gtia.com/2014/05/12/fired-up-my-colecovision-adam-for-the-first-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-12T11:56:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-05-12T11:56:00+02:00</updated><author><name>gozar</name></author><id>tag:gtia.com,2014-05-12:/2014/05/12/fired-up-my-colecovision-adam-for-the-first-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At some time I picked up a Colecovision Adam (complete) with several books and datapacks.

I was disappointed Donkey Kong wasn't in the box, but Donkey Kong Jr. was. As I was cleaning and arranging my basement lab, I decided I had better at least try out the Colecovision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first turn it on, you are put into some sort of typewriter mode. I don't have a ribbon in the printer, and the print head didn't like being turned on. Eventually, the printer stopped jamming the print head to the side, and I could type in the typewriter. I then switched it to word processing mode. Unless I'm missing something, this mode was terrible. This came out the same year as AtariWriter was released, and it doesn't even have full screen editing. I would have hated to actually use this to word process. That is, unless I'm missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was to try out the data packs. They look like normal audio cassettes, but work like the tape back up drives I used to use at work. I put Donkey Kong into the unity, and hit the reset slider besides the cartridge port (luckily I had the manual :-). And there I was playing DK Jr! Unfortunately, while it looks good, it doesn't play very much like the original. The chomping creatures (I'm sure they have a name) move too slow. &lt;/p&gt;

I remember I bough it for the Spartados X cartridge and R-time 8, but didn't realize everything else that was in it. I found an XF551 case which apparently had a CSS 3.5" upgrade kit installed. After stealing a 3.5" drive mechanism from an old PC, I was able to format my first 3.5" disk on my trusty Atari 800XL! (Actually, it took me 4 tries to find a disk that would format. I was using an ST to format a disk first to make sure it wasn't the upgrade causing the formatting to fail.)&lt;/p&gt;
