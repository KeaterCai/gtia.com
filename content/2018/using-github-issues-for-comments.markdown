For publishing this website, I use [Pelican](TK), a static website generator. Publishing a static website has many advantages, such as no databases required and the ability to host for free on Github. The biggest downside is the lack of commenting on articles. A lot of static websites will use [Disqus](TK), which is works but then I'll have ads on my website. As I researched options, I came across [Utterances](https://utteranc.es).
