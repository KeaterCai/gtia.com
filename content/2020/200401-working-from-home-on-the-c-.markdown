In honor of Apple's 44th birthday today, I decided to set up my //c+ as a terminal using my [homebuilt wifi modem](https://gtia.com/2019/10/23/setting-up-a-wifi-modem-with-the-chip-computer/).

Getting modem.mgr going was not fun, but once I read the manual and figured it out, I was good to go. The vt220 emulation didn't give me any problems, even with unicode characters. I was able to connect at 19.2K without issue also.

I didn't use the 9" screen for very long, it was just too small at 80 columns. I dug out an AppleColor Composite Monitor IIe (say that ten times fast) and used it for the majority of the day.

All in all, it worked really well. I'm even using it to write this article!
