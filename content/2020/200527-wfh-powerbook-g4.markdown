I didn't change out the [Mac SE/30](TK) for a couple of weeks, but for this week I dug out one of my favorite laptops, the Apple PowerBook G4.

Back in the 00s I used a 15" PowerBook G4 and had access to the 12" iBooks, but never got to really use the 12" PowerBook G4. I have been watching eBay auctions and finally picked up this beauty.

I love the form factor of the 12" PowerBooks. It would be amazing if a company offered a laptop like this today. The screen has a matte finish, so it's not like I'm looking in a mirror, and I really like the 4:3 aspect ratio.

Using it for working for home almost feels like it's cheating. Although surfing the internet is painful, iTerm runs well on it making it a great CLI terminal. The keyboard is a little stiff, it really gives your fingers a workout. I may leave it out for a couple of weeks...
