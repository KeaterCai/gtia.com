&lt;p&gt;Don't let the GW2k name fool you, this is a 15" Sony Trinitron monitor, capable of 1024x768 at 75Hz. It was a pretty sweet monitor back in 1994, and still is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the CRT, especially since I can adjust the screen to fill it up and the lower 640x400 resolution doesn't look as blocky as it does when using an LCD. I did try out a Dell 20" 4:3 LCD that I use with my retrocomputers, but it wouldn't expand out the image to fill the screen. The Gateway monitor looks sweet anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everyone moving to LCDs, I wonder if I can find a VGA CRT that will sync with the Atari models...&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2016 19:33:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:gtia.com,2016-03-05:2016/03/05/i-should-have-bought-a-mono-vga-cable-for-my-megaste-a-long-time-ago/</guid></item></channel></rss>
