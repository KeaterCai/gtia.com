For those that aren't familiar with the Atari 400, it shipped with a membrane keyboard. Although it was pretty good for being a membrane keyboard, it wasn't as good …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">gozar</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 20:49:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:gtia.com,2018-12-07:/2018/12/07/christmas-break-project-upgrading-my-b-key-atari-400-with-48-52k-of-ram-and-the-super-color-cpu-card/</guid><category>atari400</category><category>upgrade</category></item><item><title>Taking RetroPie to the next level with a Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 11s</title><link>https://gtia.com/2018/11/25/taking-retropie-to-the-next-level-with-a-lenovo-ideapad-yoga-11s/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;With the Christmas season coming, and knowing that I would be spending time away from home, I struggled with how to bring some retro along with me.

&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a Nec Multisync 1970VX VGA monitor for use on my older RGB computers (Atari ST/STE/Amiga/CoCo 3/800XL with VBXE). It works well with the Amiga. Unfortunately, I can't get it to show up with my Mega STe.

problems. The biggest is the screen corrupting of vim when running 
through tmux. The problem is there with screen also. If I use vim

&lt;p&gt;I picked up a couple of DEC VT420 terminals from a school auction about 
20 years ago. Unfortunately, I never did anything with them because I 
didn't have any way to hook them up. The VT420 terminal uses an MMJ 
connector, which kind of looks like an RJ11 (phone connector …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 20:37:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:gtia.com,2018-10-22:/2018/10/22/trying-out-my-vt420/</guid><category>vt420</category></item><item><title>First post from my iMac G4</title><link>https://gtia.com/2017/04/24/first-post-from-my-imac-g4/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a test post from my iMac G4 running Leopard from an SSD drive.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2017 15:37:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:gtia.com,2017-04-24:/2017/04/24/first-post-from-my-imac-g4/</guid><category>ppc</category><category>powerpc</category><category>g4</category><category>imacg4</category></item><item><title>I should have bought a mono VGA cable for my MegaSTE a long time ago</title><link>https://gtia.com/2016/03/05/i-should-have-bought-a-mono-vga-cable-for-my-megaste-a-long-time-ago/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I went in the hunt for a better monitor for my MegaSTE and ended up using my old Gateway 2000 monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't let the GW2k name fool you, this is a 15" Sony Trinitron monitor, capable of 1024x768 at 75Hz.

&lt;p&gt;It feels weird using the 800XL on an VGA LCD screen, almost like I'm in emulation. To convert the VBXE output to VGA I'm using …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2015 18:41:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:gtia.com,2015-12-29:/2015/12/29/vbxe-and-ultimate-1mb-success/</guid><category>vbxe</category><category>u1m</category></item><item><title>VBXE to GBS-8200 to VGA monitor is a success</title><link>https://gtia.com/2015/12/28/vbxe-to-gbs-8200-to-vga-monitor-is-a-success/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After much troubleshooting, I now have VGA output from an 800XL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="VBXE in Action" src="//cdn.gtia.com/pics/2015/IMG_9078-2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VBXE plugs into the 5 pin connector on the GBS-8200, which then goes out as VGA. Unfortunately, the Apple monitor doesn't have a VGA plug, so I have an adapter to convert it. Looks very good!&lt;/p&gt;

I was disappointed Donkey Kong wasn't in the box, but Donkey Kong Jr. was. As I was cleaning and arranging my basement lab, I decided I had better at least try out the Colecovision.&lt;/p&gt;
