The original plan was to find a BBS that would run under SDX. I have an older MyIDE+Flash cart with a 256MB IDE drive which isn't being used right now, so I thought that would be good to get a BBS up on. Unfortunately, I haven't found any BBS software that supports SDX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I've been using an 800XL with a VBXE as my daily driver I thought I would put my Atari 800 with an Incognito installed into service running a BBS. Again, I couldn't get Carina II to run (hangs after MOE starts) or BBS Express Pro 4.0b (complains that CMDPATH.DAT isn't found, even though it is). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is now to take a couple of days off and approach the problem fresh.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mr.rcollins</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2016 20:37:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:gtia.com,2016-01-18:2016/01/18/trying-to-get-a-bbs-running/</guid><category>bbs</category></item></channel></rss>
